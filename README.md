| OBJECTIVE |  The purpose of this practice activity is to help students apply their knowledge of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python. This activity will serve as preparation for the laboratory examination by reinforcing the use of classes, objects, attributes, methods, user input, and output. 

| PRIMARY INSTRUCTION |  Create one Python program only using Object-Oriented Programming.  Your program must:  Use one class Contain at least 3 attributes Contain at least 3 methods Use input() for all data Use print() to display results Run correctly in the terminal/console

| PROGRAM ACTIVITY |  Library Book Management System     Description:  Create a simple program that manages a book in a small library.
